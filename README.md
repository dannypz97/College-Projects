# College-Projects
This repo hosts all the projects I've created while pursuing my B.E..

Do look at my Round Robin Scheduling project - I consider it one of the more challenging projects I've undertaken since it required a fair bit of thinking and tinkering and tweaking to come up with the animation algorithm. 

NOTE: Read the About.txt in each project folder to get a brief overview about the project.
