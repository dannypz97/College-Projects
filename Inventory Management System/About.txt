I worked on this desktop application project in my 5th semester for my DBMS lab.
It is a very simple Inventory Management Sytsem for a fictional sports and electronics goods store that allows an authorized user to perform various inventory
management tasks.

I've used the JavaFX toolkit to build the application. Communication between the application and database is achieved using the JDBC thin driver.

NOTE: To login, use 'admin' for both username and password.
