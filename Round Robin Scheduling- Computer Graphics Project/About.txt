This is my Computer Graphics Project titled "Round Robin Scheduling with OpenGL" which I worked on during my 6th semester.
It simulates how the round robin CPU scheduling algorithm works on a set of processes.

NOTE: Please keep the magnitude of numbers keyed into input (especially the number of processes) on CLI small. 

Project can be run directly from Executable/RoundRobinSimulation.exe.
NOTE: freeglut.dll dependency is required in the same folder as the .exe to run the application.


Known issues:-

1)Entering anything other than simple integer numbers for inputs on the opening CLI causes issues. 

2)On the opening application screen that says "Press any key to advance to the next screen", any key has to be pressed twice to continue.
