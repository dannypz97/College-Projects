Throughout the movie i just kept thinking to myself, \"so when are we gonna start wrapping up?\" That\'s not a good sign. Don\'t get me wrong - where this movie goes and each scene in of itself is pretty good, the film just lacks real momentum. The film doesn\'t really go anywhere, which would be fine if there was a central theme for the spiraling story. But The ending was kinda poop, so that doesn\'t help.

In \"The Nun\" they\'re overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn\'t keep the audience captivated any other way.\r\n\r\nThe plot is basic to say the least, it\'s almost like they just threw it together in 5 minutes to make up a back story for The Nun. The film had so much potential to give the audience a interesting creepy back story to one of the conjuring\'s iconic villains. Instead we\'re saturated with filler for the 1st and 2nd act , and FINALLY get something going on the final act . Up until then it\'s nothing but jump scare city . So if that\'s up your alley for horror movies then you\'ll love this . I personally think the brief amount of time The Nun was in the Conjuring 2 was 100000x better than this full length film.\r\n\r\nThey also tried to go with this new trend of adding some comedy into a horror film and it\'s just badly placed and awkward . The acting is okay . Taissa Farmiga & Demien Bichir are the main characters and give pretty good performances. \r\n\r\nAnyway, Overall this movie could\'ve gone straight to DVD or Netflix . Don\'t think it deserved to hit the big screen if it wasn\'t going to be directed by Wan . There\'s some creepy/scary enjoyable moments but overall it\'s very cliche and downright boring at times. Watch when you\'re at home on a rainy day with nothing do. Don\'t waste ur money like i did','2018-11-05'),(00001,'015',1.0,'I lost so many brain cells watching this thrash. No one should have to sit through such an ordeal.','2018-11-05'),(00001,'016',7.5,'This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.\r\n\r\nThe story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel \"Nostromo\" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.\r\n\r\nThe music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.\r\n\r\nThis is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. \"Alien\" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10','2018-11-07'),(00001,'017',6.5,'I\'ve been eagerly awaiting this episode, thinking it was going to be much more action-packed or incorporating some of the more juicy bits of narrative from the over-800 page book. I ought to have known going in that, at 2:18 running time, the movie was too short. Even considering the tweaking that needed to be done to incorporate information differently than the book presents it (like by-passing the house elves storyline), at least a half-hour more could\'ve been left in to really build up the story. The scenes we do see are well acted, there are obvious clues alluding to the final installment, and the special effects are dazzling. But one leaves the theater breathless and disoriented as if one ate a rich meal too quickly. Especially exasperating considering we had to sit through 20 minutes of TV commercials and coming attractions--I would\'ve paid extra to see another 20 minutes of movie instead.','2018-11-07'),(00001,'018',8.0,'After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. \r\n\r\nThe hype train let me down.\r\n\r\nI was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out, some were inexplicably added (Blomkvist\'s memories of the island became far too important and contrived), and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent, but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed, just bratty and rude. Worst of all, I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed, strange new take on the story. \r\n\r\nAs a lover of foreign films, I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However, I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time, that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully, the American adaptation (not a remake) delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jam-packed with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet, despite being more robust, the English- language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced, feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you, the clue-finding makes more sense, and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change (though the ending, which mirrors the book\'s ending, could have been arranged better). Craig, Mara, and even Plummer are spot-on in their roles and feel more fleshed-out as characters. Mara, in particular, inhabits Larsson\'s Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth\'s silent, borderline-autistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book\'s description. She allows herself to be vulnerable, but clearly regrets it over time. It\'s a captivating performance.\r\n\r\nIf someone were to ask me, personally, which version to see, I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours.','2018-11-07'),(00002,'001',7.5,'I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born, and quickly jumps into him being in his 20\'s and saving people. They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don\'t have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like \'The Hobbit\', I didn\'t think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun, entertaining movie.','2013-09-10'),(00002,'004',7.5,'I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.','2010-11-24'),(00002,'005',9.0,'Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist\'s opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.','2008-11-05'),(00002,'006',8.5,'Schindler\'s List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn\'t anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler\'s List did. Schindler\'s List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler\'s List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler\'s List.','2005-07-27'),(00002,'007',10.0,'I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.','2005-06-02'),(00002,'008',9.0,'Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven\'t seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better.

If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of \"everything is gonna be alright\" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don\'t get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I\'m definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.','2018-04-03'),(00002,'014',5.0,'Was there a plot? Nun. Were there any scares? Nun. Any good acting?

This film will always remain a classic. It\'s scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There\'s also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It\'s fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let\'s hope they\'ll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !','2018-11-07'),(00002,'017',8.5,'Once again, I believe that the series is only getting better with each progressive movie. I attended a preview screening tonight and was completely blown away by the movie. While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie, how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said, Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book, and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried, I laughed, and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn\'t breathe from the tension.\r\n\r\nWhat really made the movie for me was the talent of the actors. As expected, the older cast members deliver some of the best acting England has to offer. Sidenote: there is something about Emma Thompson where every time she cries in a movie, I start tearing up myself. I was especially impressed with how much Daniel, Emma (Watson), and Rupert have improved their acting since the last movie. Having come from seeing Daniel in Equus two weeks ago, I was expecting a lot from him. Even after seeing him display more intensity than I thought possible on stage, he surprised me in Phoenix. His emotions were so raw and genuine that I literally got goosebumps.\r\n\r\nWell done to the cast and crew! I can\'t wait for the next one!!','2018-11-07'),(00002,'018',9.0,'I liked both the Swedish version and the US version...I think both are great in their own right.

I\'m talking about just a regular ol\' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I\'m sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90\'s. But isn\'t that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP.

I don\'t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it\'s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he\'s done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

I\'m freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like \'Alien\' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, \'Alien\' is the atomic bomb.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, \'Alien\' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I\'ve watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven\'t been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.','2018-11-07'),(00003,'017',8.0,'I actually was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview on Monday. The \"experience\" was lousy, but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book, you won\'t be disappointed.\r\n\r\nFor the negative...there were, of course, MANY things that were omitted from the film. As a huge fan of the books, I still must be realistic. I knew there would be a lot of information left out. There were a few things that I felt could have made the story richer if they had been included, but I won\'t go into detail so I don\'t give away any of the film\'s changes. There were a few changes that made me frown at times, but as the story played out, it did make the film flow well. One of their worst casting decisions, Michael Gambon, was actually tolerable in this one, for the most part. I am NOT a fan of his portrayal of Dumbledore, but I guess he worked for this film simply because, for the majority of the story, he is supposed to be acting somewhat aloof towards Harry. That worked for him. I miss the subtlety that Richard Harris brought to that role, and, while he wasn\'t dreadful in this one, I still believe that there are countless other well known actors in the UK that could have done this role better justice. There wasn\'t enough Molly or Hagrid for me though. I love both of those characters.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, the special effects were very well done. The thestrals were marvelous--eerie, but strangely peaceful creatures. Evanna Lynch could not have been more spot on as Luna. Her voice, mannerisms and demeanor were amazing. My only complaint about her was that she wasn\'t on screen enough. :o) Imelda Staunton, as Umbridge, and Helena Bonham Carter, as Bella, have to be two of the BEST casting decisions that they have with regard to these films. They were SO incredible. I was actually quite impressed with Dan, Rupert and Emma as well. They have come quite far in their acting abilities. They have finally achieved the art of saying a lot without necessarily opening their mouths. The scene in the common room following the kiss between Harry and Cho was hysterical. Kreacher and Grawp were great additions to the films. Fred and George\'s exit was very well done, albeit slightly different. The film, if taken by itself, was really good. Unfortunately, it\'s a lot different from the book. But, as I\'m doing a film review and not a comparison, I\'ll give it 8 out of 10, because I was highly entertained.\r\n\r\nOur \"sneak preview\" was interrupted in the middle due to a problem with the film, and I think we still missed some of it. We lined up 3 hours before the movie was supposed to begin, it started late, it was interrupted in the middle for over 30 minutes, we were wanded for metal and electronics every time we went in or out...I think we\'ll just wait until opening week next time. It\'s crowded, but a lot less trouble.\r\n\r\nWe are actually going to see it again.','2018-11-07'),(00004,'012',1.0,'This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war.
