Our college had given us a simple task of creating an Online Shopping Application in our 3rd semester as part of our Data Structures Course to demonstrate how various data structures
work together in a system.
The weird thing was they wanted us to make it a console application since we weren't expected to work with web technolgies just yet.

Most of the class didn't even do it.

I did put in a days effort to get something up because I like working on my projects :-).
